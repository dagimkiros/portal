       <p>My name is Dagim kiros. As of now, I'm pursuing an application development track at year-up with the intent of becoming a software engineer.</p>
       
       <p>Since I was introduced to development, I have gained skills in problem-solving and a few programming skills such as HTML, CSS and java script and in the next five to ten years I see myself partnering with a nonprofit to teach young students and narrow the tech industry race gap. </p>
       
       <p>Being a developer is a lifetime journey, in which we are constantly learning and becoming more proficient. My journey so far has taught me discipline and consistency. Although I am excited to see where my next step might take me, I am prepared to give it my all no matter what the outcome.</p>
